#
# This Dockerfile is used for local development and is intended for use with
# a compose environment which weaves in the source via volume at
# /src/buildertools/src/github.com/buildertools/swarm-hooks.
# This image uses gulpjs to watch those source files, build them on changes,
# run tests, gofmt, etc, and finally relaunch the service if successful.
