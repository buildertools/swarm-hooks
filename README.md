# swarm-hooks

Docker Swarm provides a Docker Engine abstraction on top of a cluster of machines. This project, "Swarm-Hooks" exposes the Swarm API and wraps delegation with a pre/post hook processing chain. This pluggable chain allows the user to build clusters integrated with other "cluster-kernel" level services like secret managers, certificate authorities, monitoring subsystems, and fault injection tooling.
