# Uses an empty image and mounts in the only binary.
# This is helpful in development because it remove the image build process
# from the redeployment chain. This is Go afterall and we like our builds
# minimal. Using volumes in this way we don't even need to recreate the
# container. We can simply restart the existing one.
